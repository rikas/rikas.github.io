            I'm a freelance web developer, working with Ruby and Ruby on Rails for 10+ years. This
            is where I write about my projects and practices and share interesting stuff about
            programming in general.

<p>Hi, my name is Ricardo Otero.</p>

<p>Born in Coimbra, Portugal, I’m a software engineer based in Lisbon, Portugal.</p>

<p>
  I have a masters degree in Computer Science but I've been into web development way before that.
  I laught myself Perl then PHP and ended up falling in love with Ruby.
</p>

<p>
  I'm working mainly with Ruby and Ruby on Rails since 2007, but I always try to learn new things,
  so I've been more into the inevitable world of Javascript recently (specially React).
</p>

<p>
  I've worked in different companies over the years and I always gravitate towards the startup
  scene. After co-founding and being the CTO of my own startup for 3 years I now work as a freelance
  web developer working remote first.
</p>

<p>
  I also teach at <a href="https://www.lewagon.com/lisbon" target="_blank">Le Wagon</a>, a code
  bootcamp, in Lisbon. It has been a wonderful experience so far. Helping people to completely
  change their careers teaching things I love is just perfect!
</p>

  code is publicly available, so if you see something that’s incorrect, please submit a pull request.
</p>

<p>
  I tend to write about things that I’m currently working on or learning. Topics vary quite a bit,
  but just about everything is programmer flavored. Here’s a small sample of some posts that I wrote
  that I enjoy.
</p>

<p>Thanks for stopping by!</p>
